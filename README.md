# Design-Pattern

## What is a Pattern

* Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. 

* They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

* You can’t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. 

* The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. 

* You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.

* Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. 

* While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. 

* The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.

### What does the pattern consist of?

Here are the sections that are usually present in a pattern description:

* **Intent** of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.

* **Motivation** further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.

* **Structure** of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.

* **Code example** in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.

### Why should I learn patterns?

* The truth is that you might manage to work as a programmer for many years without knowing about a single pattern.

* Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. 

* Even if you never encounter these problems, knowing patterns is still useful because it teaches you how to solve all sorts of problems using principles of object-oriented design.

* Design patterns define a common language that you and your teammates can use to communicate more efficiently.

* You can say, “Oh, just use a Singleton for that,” and everyone will understand the idea behind your suggestion. No need to explain what a singleton is if you know the pattern and its name

### Classification of patterns

* Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability to the entire system being designed.

* The most basic and low-level patterns are often called idioms. They usually apply only to a single programming language.

* The most universal and high-level patterns are architectural patterns. Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language. Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.

* In addition, all patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose. This covers three main groups of patterns:

1. **[Creational patterns](#creational-patterns)** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

2. **[Structural patterns](#structural-patterns)** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

3. **[Behavioral patterns](#behavioral-patterns)** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
